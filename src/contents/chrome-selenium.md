To install Google Chrome and the necessary drivers for Selenium scraping on an EC2 instance running Ubuntu, you'll need to follow a few steps. This guide assumes you have an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu and you have SSH access to your instance. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Connect to Your EC2 Instance

First, you'll need to SSH into your EC2 instance. Open your terminal or command prompt and use the SSH command. You'll need the `.pem` key file and the public DNS or IP address of your EC2 instance.

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-dns
```

Replace `/path/to/your-key.pem` with the path to your PEM file, and `your-ec2-public-dns` with the public DNS or IP of your EC2 instance.

### Step 2: Update Your Package Lists

Update the package lists for upgrades and new package installations.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Step 3: Install Google Chrome

Download the latest version of Google Chrome.

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```

Install Google Chrome.

```bash
sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```

### Step 4: Install ChromeDriver

ChromeDriver is necessary for Selenium to interact with the Chrome browser. First, find out the version of Google Chrome you installed:

```bash
google-chrome --version
```

Then, download the corresponding ChromeDriver from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Make sure the ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version.

As an example, if your Google Chrome version is `XX`, replace `XX` with your Chrome version in the command below to download ChromeDriver:

```bash
wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/XX.XX.XX/chromedriver_linux64.zip
```

Unzip the downloaded file.

```bash
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
```

Move the `chromedriver` to `/usr/local/bin/` so it's in the PATH.

```bash
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
```

### Step 5: Install Selenium

You can install Selenium using pip. If you don't have pip installed, you can install it by running:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Then, install Selenium:

```bash
pip3 install selenium
```

### Step 6: Test Your Setup

Create a simple Python script to test your Selenium setup with Chrome.

```python
from selenium import webdriver

options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument('--headless')  # Run Chrome in headless mode (without a UI)
options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')
options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')

driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)

driver.get("https://www.example.com")
print(driver.title)

driver.quit()
```

Save this script as `test_selenium.py` and run it:

```bash
python3 test_selenium.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, this script should print the title of the page without opening a graphical web browser.

This setup will allow you to run Selenium with Chrome on your EC2 Ubuntu instance for web scraping or automated testing.
