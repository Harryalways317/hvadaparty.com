I'm working fully remote at [Hexon Global](https://www.hexonlabs.com) as a Software Engineer on the Backend & Data team.

I'm currently expanding my Computer Science major with more college-level courses, with the goal of working on lower-level systems as a career.

I'm trying to track my progress over at my [digital garden](https://notes.jakegut.com/extended-cs). Check out my post on [Self Guided Operating Systems.](/posts/sg-os/)

In my world I:

- Started working out at GYM
- Visited Banglore, Chennai, Hyderabad
- Hyperfixated on \<special interest\> (it's always changing, checkout the cycle below)
- Learning guitar

My cycle of special interests:

- Graphics Programming
- Operating Systems **_<-- we are here_**
- Distributed Systems
- Compilers and Interpreters
- FOSS
